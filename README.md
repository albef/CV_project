# Computer Vision Final Project
This repository contains the final project of Computer Vision course at the master degree of ICT for Internet and Multimedia (former Telecommunications Engineering) at University of Padua, A.A. 2017/2018.

The present project consisted in the development of a basic computer vision system that is capable of detect a given object in an image and estimate the object pose, i.e in our case the viewing angle of the camera with respect to the object.

The dataset used is available at http://www.isy.liu.se/cvl/research/objrec/posedb/datasets.html.
